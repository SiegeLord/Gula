## Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.

## Rules

1. *genre rule #136: Food & Nutrition* - The animals eat food to grow.
   Different types of food has different effects.

2. *art rule #180: Cute and adorable* - The animals are cute and adorable.

3. *tech rule #4: Use Layers* - The animal models have multiple layers, to
   enable some stylized 3D appearance. Also, the level is lit using a lightmap,
   which can be thought of as a texture layer.

4. *tech rule #131: Incorporate the golden ratio (Ï† = 1.618) somewhere.* - The
   animals grow in size in proportion to the golden ratio. In the
   music, all phrases, proportions and melodies are mapped and based on
   the golden ratio and on the Fibonacci sequence. The gameplay music
   is in the key of F, tempo is 112.3 bpm and lasts 1.6 minutes. In the
   menu music, the chord progression length grows in Fibonacci sequence
   and lasting 0.6 minutes.
